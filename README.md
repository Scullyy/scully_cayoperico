# FAQ <a id="faq"></a>
**How do I close the hanger gates?**
Navigate to `data/ipl.lua` and replace both the `h4_islandairstrip_doorsopen` and `h4_islandairstrip_doorsopen_lod` IPL's with `h4_islandairstrip_doorsclosed` and `h4_islandairstrip_doorsclosed_lod`.

**How do I enable the anti-aircraft guns?**
Navigate to `data/ipl.lua` and add both the `h4_aa_guns` and `h4_aa_guns_lod` IPL's to the table.

**How do I enable the boat blockers?**
Navigate to `data/ipl.lua` and add the `h4_boatblockers` IPL to the table, I advise not doing this though as this will prevent boats from docking in most areas.

**How do I enable the sea gate?**
Navigate to `data/ipl.lua` and add the `h4_underwater_gate_closed` IPL to the table.

**How do I enable the sea mines?**
Navigate to `data/ipl.lua` and add the `h4_islandx_sea_mines` IPL to the table.
